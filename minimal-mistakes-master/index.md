# Hello!!

I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) with a degree in Neuroscience. 

Professionally, I am interested in topics such as understanding the neural basis of cognition, discovering new treatments for psychatric disorders, and finding ways to improve our mental health. 

I am currently looking for a job as a research assistant, lab manger, or research technician. So, if you know anyone who is looking for someone to fill these roles, I would greatly appreciate it if you contacted me by filling out the form below (name, email, and message required only!).
